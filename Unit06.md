**Unit 6: Continent-Wide Challenges for Africa** <span id="6"></span> 
*One essential aspect of living in a globalized or globalizing world is
that notions of a border or boundary have new meanings.  Borders become
more open—and maybe even malleable.  The same globalizing trends apply
to sub-Saharan Africa.  Sometimes these global realities are
problematic, leading to negative spin-offs.  Sometimes promising new
starts occur, spurring growth and other positive changes.  Sometimes,
both reactions occur.   The border-crossing reality of global public
health and disease is one such issue.  One can see both the terrible
affliction caused by disease as well as the promise of innovative
delivery and problem-solving applications.  Three of the most
significant challenges that face African politics today are public
health and the HIV/AIDS crisis across Africa; intra-state conditions
ripe for protracted conflict; and the difficulty of sustaining democracy
in governance.  These challenges respect no borders.    *

     Instructions: The link above takes you to the table of contents of
    the December 2011 edition of the African Journal of Political
    Science and International Relations; click on ‘Full article – pdf’
    to access the article. Here, the author explores the relationship
    between western notions of democracy and African traditional
    political systems. Such political systems exhibited numerous
    democratic elements but were undermined by the imposition of
    colonial rule in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Given that
    democracy is not foreign to Africa, Bradley argues that African
    societies tend to perceive democracy in different, but not less
    valid, terms. Progress in democratization, then, should not be
    evaluated from a western perspective, but from African
    perspectives.

     Note that the 1990s saw a wave of   democratization emerge in
    Eastern Europe and other parts of the  world.  Though many African
      states experienced a variety of governmental changes during this
    time, very few achieved full democracy.  While reading the article,
    ask yourself whether you agree with the claim that Africa has fallen
    behind in moving towards democracy and work to identify the reasons
    why liberal democracy has not taken root in the continent.

    contribution to the international human rights discourse by
    including so-called ‘third generation’ rights (rights that accrue to
    groups or peoples, not individuals) and by explicitly linking rights
    and duties of the individual. However, the African Charter has been
    criticized for its inclusion of ‘clawback’ clauses, conditional
    language that allows states to limit and/or restrict human rights in
