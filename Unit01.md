**Unit 1: Pre-Colonial and Colonial Africa: An Overview** <span
id="1"></span> 
*While some historians have characterized pre-colonial Africa as
stateless, pre-colonial Africa did not lack political organization.
 African societies developed diverse political systems based on local
needs and realities.  Centralized kingdoms emerged in some regions,
while other regions formed more decentralized governments based on
kinship.  However, colonialism interrupted Africa’s natural political
development by replacing or significantly altering institutions and
power configurations.  
  
 Lasting roughly from the 1880s to the early 1960s, colonialism not only
introduced new borders and systems of governance but also changed many
aspects of African culture and society by introducing new languages,
religions, and social hierarchies.  These influences are still evident
today, although scholars debate the extent to which colonialism explains
contemporary phenomena like civil war and economic underdevelopment.  
 This unit will present an overview of pre-colonial and colonial Africa,
highlighting the ways in which colonialism has shaped African
politics—and nearly every aspect of modern-day Africa—over the last six
decades.  This unit will also introduce you to some historical concepts
like Pan-Africanism and neocolonialism that later units will examine in
more detail.  Finally, this unit will encourage you to familiarize
yourself with Africa’s political map.*

    that emerged in Africa over the past millennia. Take note of the
    vast differences in political organization (e.g. city-states,
    kingdoms, federations, etc.) and the intricate forms of political
    administration that developed. A form of political organization
    common in pre-colonial Africa but not addressed in these readings is
    referred to as acephalous (or state-less) societies. Characteristic
    of such societies is the absence of centralized political authority.
    Such political governance centered around kinship, age groups or
    multiple leaders;  the Nuer, Balanta, and Igbo are examples of
    acephalous societies.

     Instructions: Note that the European powers started to colonize
    Africa during the second part of the nineteenth century, when they
    wanted to have full control over Africa largely for economic and
    geopolitical reasons.  By 1884, “The Scramble for Africa” had
    intensified as France, Great Britain, Germany, and Portugal staked
    claims on African territory.   From November 15, 1884 to January 20,
    1885, under the leadership of German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck,
    European powers convened and set up the rules for the colonization
    of Africa.  This meeting and its resultant agreement are now known
    as the Berlin Conference.  This reading should take you
    approximately 30 minutes to complete.

    Africa](http://exhibitions.nypl.org/africanaage/essay-colonization-of-africa.html)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    essay on the colonization of Africa.  Dr. Iweriebor explores various
    motivations for Europe’s imperial interests in Africa, the conquest
    of the continent, and African responses to European intrusions.  
        
     Additionally, Dr. Iweriebor discusses the two dominant forms of
    colonial rule that were adopted by the European colonizers: indirect
    rule and direct rule. The British espoused indirect rule, a system
    of a small number of European officials who ruled through existing
    African leaders and institutions, as their preferred method for
    colonial governance. Indirect rule contrasted the French system of
    direct rule.  Driven by the notion of assimilation, the French
    administrative structure was characterized by smaller regional units
    with a French colonial official at the head of each unit.  While
    “traditional” rulers remained with direct rule, these rulers lost
    their typical responsibilities.    
        
     Be sure to take a look at the picture gallery to the right of the
    essay; the descriptions provide interesting glimpses into the
    colonial conquest and life under colonialism.  
        
     Finally, please compare and contrast the accounts of the colonial
    conquest and colonialism offered by the author of the Economist
    article and by Dr. Iweriebor. Notwithstanding the obvious
    differences in academic rigor, a basic analysis reveals two
    fundamentally disparate orientations to the topic—one is Eurocentric
    and one is Afrocentric.

    colonizing states and the extent of their reach. As a consequence of
    World War I (1914-1918), Germany lost its colonies in Africa.  These
    colonies were placed under the control of France, Great Britain, and
    Belgium in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

    particular attention to the strategies employed by Africans, the
    types of demands that were at the center of resistance movements,
    and external factors that shaped such resistance.  It becomes clear
    that independence was the direct result of consistent and persistent
    political agency on the part of Africans throughout the colonial

    Makalani’s essay on the development of Pan-Africanism. 
    Pan-Africanism, developed outside of Africa in response to
    colonialism and racial discrimination, played a key role in
    crystallizing African thought and anti-colonial activism, ultimately
    leading to independence.  Pan-Africanism continues to play an
    important role in the pursuit of policies on a continent-wide scale,
    as we will explore in later units.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the text of
    this 1961 speech by Ghanaian independence movement leader and the
    first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah.  Nkrumah was a staunch
    supporter of Pan-Africanism. He firmly believed that African states,
    upon gaining their independence, needed to rely on each other to
    overcome the obstacles of political and economic development.  To
    that end, Nkrumah advocated a very close political union between
    independent African states that would ultimately lead to a “United
    States of Africa.”  , Because few people shared his vision, such
    close cooperation among African states never materialized.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the webpage
    in its entirety.  This text presents four examples that demonstrate
    the various paths to independence that different African countries
    have taken.  
        
     Note that by the end of World War I, with the exception of Ethiopia
    and Liberia, the rest of Africa had been colonized.  European
    colonizers quelled African resistance and managed to rule the
    continent.  Shortly thereafter, World War II began to have a
    profound effect on African consciousness, when North Africa became a
    battle ground and Africans were recruited to fight for the Allies in
    Europe and Asia.  In the late 1940s, returning soldiers started to
    question their European colonizers and began to form political
    parties in order to mobilize resistance.  Furthermore, powers like
    France and Britain, emerging from foreign occupations and economic
    shocks of World War II, were no longer able to finance or justify
    maintaining colonies in Africa.  The 1950s saw the emergence of
    African independence movements, and in 1960 alone, 17 African
    countries became independent.  Not all African countries took the
    same route to independence.  In this section, you will read about
    the different paths that different African states took.

     Instructions: The link above takes you to a list of Africa maps
    available in this map collection.  Select the 11<sup>th</sup> map
    from the top (the first reference map listed) to open the PDF file. 
    This map depicts Africa’s countries (including Africa’s ‘newest’
    state South Sudan), major rivers, lakes, and deserts.  Please
    familiarize yourself with the physicality of the African continent
    and gain a general understanding of the location of African
    states.  
        
     The political map of Africa is relatively new.  Since the end of
    colonialism and the emergence of new countries on the African
    continent, Africa’s political map has solidified into its present
    form.  Please note the fragmentation of the continent in terms of
    the sheer number of countries as well as the peculiarities of their
    shapes.  Specifically, there are a total of 55 countries in Africa
    (those who do not recognize Western Sahara as an independent country
    put the number at 54).  Some countries are rather oddly shaped.  The
    Gambia in western Africa, for example, extends for 220 miles along
    the Gambia River and is no more than 18 miles wide; it has a small
    coastline and is otherwise surrounded by Senegal.  Lesotho, on the
    other hand, is completely surrounded by South Africa.  Also, you
    should note the unusually high number of landlocked countries
    (countries that lack direct access to the sea).  Africa has 15
    landlocked countries; these countries are among the world’s least
    developed countries in part due  to transportation barriers.  Such
    peculiarities also highlight the fact that Africa’s borders were
    drawn with little regard for cultural or political boundaries on the
    ground. Therefore, it is remarkable that Africa has experienced very
    few secessionist movements (i.e. efforts to break away from existing
    states).  The recent independence of South Sudan is a notable
    exception.

     Instructions:  Please click on the link above, and view the entire
    historical documentary, which is approximately 45 minutes long.  As
    you view this documentary, consider the extent to which colonialism
    had a negative effect on Africa.  Do these European colonizers
    continue to influence their former colonies?  How so?  
        
     Note that despite earning independence, much of Africa has remained
    underdeveloped and unstable, enduring ongoing civil conflict.  The
    colonial powers introduced artificial boundaries, exploited natural
    resources, and generated tension on the continent.  While
    colonialism is not the only influence on contemporary African
    politics, many scholars still view it as the root cause of many of
    Africa’s ills.  A string of African dictatorships, widespread
    corruption, and the Cold War have only exacerbated these problems in
    the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

     Instructions: Access the webpage above for a brief overview of the
    practice and legacy of colonialism.  The material presented includes
    an exploration of the primary political, economic, and social
    ramifications of colonialism.  Some scholars argue that Africa’s
    political institutions are the direct outgrowths of colonial
    intervention.  Institutions such as constitutions and electoral
    rules can persist across generations, because people become
    accustomed to them and invested in them.
