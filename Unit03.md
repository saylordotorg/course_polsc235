**Unit 3: African Society and the Politics of Identity** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This unit introduces four elements of identity politics in Africa:
ethnicity, religion, gender, and class.  Scholars and the media often
portray African politics in ethnic terms.  Ethnicity is a broad concept
encompassing language, tribe, and other identity markers.  Ethnicity is
not always politically salient, but it can become politicized through
strategic manipulation or institutional mechanisms.  By many measures,
African countries are some of the most ethnically diverse in the world.
 In the post-colonial era, this diversity has complicated efforts to
build crosscutting national identities.  Whereas some countries, like
Tanzania, have implemented successful nation-building campaigns, others
struggle to accommodate cultural pluralism.  Although there is no
scholarly consensus on whether ethnic diversity increases the risk of
civil conflict, the correlation between ethnic diversity and low
economic growth is one of the most robust in political science.
 Therefore, forging national identities may be of critical importance
for Africa’s long-term development.  
    
 In contrast to the economic drawbacks of ethnic diversity, strong
religious identities may be beneficial.  For example, despite the
international attention that Nigeria’s deadly religious riots receive,
some Nigerian Muslims and Christians have forged interfaith partnerships
in the name of social justice.  
  
 This unit will also highlight encouraging trends in gender politics.
 While many African women are still marginalized and vulnerable to human
rights abuses, they are pivotal in their communities through their roles
in agriculture, family care, and entrepreneurship.  Microfinance
agencies and other aid organizations have recognized this and are
increasingly targeting women with their interventions.  Some prominent
African women, such as Wangari Maathai of Kenya and Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf of Liberia, are also paving the way for female political
participation.  
  
 Finally, this unit will examine class identity.  Although labor unions
were central in the struggle against colonialism, the conventional
wisdom is that class politics gave way to ethnic politics in the
post-colonial era.  This unit will challenge that assumption by
highlighting the emergence of an African middle class.*

    article.  Ethnicity continues to shape every sphere of life in
    Africa, including politics.  Raila Odinga, Prime Minster of Kenya,
    points out that the colonizers created identity-based politics, but
    he indicates that it has continued to influence contemporary
    politics in Africa.  As you read, ask yourself how ethnicity has
    influenced politics in various African countries.

     In this 14-page journal article, the renowned Nigerian political
    scientist, Dr. Claude Ake, explores the concept of ethnicity as it
    relates to African political processes.  Please compare and contrast
    Dr. Ake’s and Hon. Odinga’s accounts of the development of ethnic
    identities in Africa. Do they maintain divergent views on the
    significance of ethnicity with respect to democratization and
    conflict? Also, please note the brief discussion on language in Dr.
    Ake’s paper. The adoption of the colonial language as the official
    or national language by independent African states poses concrete
    problems for political participation.

     Instructions: Please read the two 2010 news articles on homophobia
    in Africa. These articles shed light on the complexities of the
    relationship between politics and religion in African societies.
    While anti-gay rhetoric is not a new phenomenon in Africa (the
    controversy surrounding the 1995 Zimbabwe International Book Fair
    and accompanying disparaging commentary by political leadership is
    one example), the recent rash of reinvigorated homophobic
    expressions is extremely concerning from a human rights viewpoint.
    Religious leadership, both African and foreign, have immense
    influence over political leaders when it comes to homosexuality. Is
    this merely a religious issue in African societies or do other
    socio-economic factors coalesce to provide a strong political base
    for religious activism vis-à-vis this issue?

    different regions, highlighting the fact that gender issues are not
    exclusive to Africa.  Indeed, growing appreciation for the
    interconnectedness of development issues has led some universities
    to place less emphasis on “area studies” and more emphasis on
    comparative fields.

    body passed the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development, which is a
    legally binding document that aims to achieve gender equality in the
    member states.  It is one example of efforts taken at the state and
    regional level to address the issue of gender inequality and
    discrimination.  Munalula’s short article offers an overview and

    will lead to progress and ameliorate women’s lives in southern
    Africa?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    article.  Political elites everywhere enjoy greater power due to
    their political and economic resources.  The masses, however, have
    the capacity to change political systems if they mobilize.  Many
    have noted that changes in Africa have occurred via popular
    movements.  In this article, Gumede argues that South Africa's
    success in eliminating apartheid was due to “mass mobilization.” 
    However, the political and economic system in post-apartheid South
    Africa came to be controlled by new elites, which gave rise to a new
    class system.  As you read, note the way in which Gumede presents
    his case and pay attention to his explanation of the impact that the
    new class system has had on politics in South Africa.  Do you think
    South Africa’s experience can be seen in other parts of Africa as
    well?
