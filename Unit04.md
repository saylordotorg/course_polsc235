**Unit 4: African Political Economies** <span id="4"></span> 
*In addition to political challenges, Africa faces related economic
challenges. Success stories like Botswana and Senegal notwithstanding,
many African countries struggle with food insecurity, low foreign
investment, and debt.  Some of these problems stem from colonialism,
which diverted trade revenues from Africa to Europe and weakened
political and economic institutions.  Countries with sizeable European
settler populations, like Zimbabwe, have also undergone contentious
post-colonial land reform programs.  Economic underdevelopment has
dominated African policy agendas since independence, despite the fact
that Africa is richer in natural resources than most continents.  This
unit will survey the African political economy, emphasizing Africa’s
position in the global marketplace.*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    article.  Despite the vast amount of natural resources it has, much
    of Africa remains underdeveloped.  In this article, Simensen
    explores the various historical factors that may account for
    Africa’s current underdevelopment.  These factors range from the
    slave trade and colonialism to globalization and weak political
    institutions.  Do you think it is reasonable to include historical
    elements in an explanation of the causes of Africa’s
    underdevelopment?  Why, or why not?

     Instructions: Please click on the links above, and read these three
    brief readings about economic and social indicators of African
    development.  When African countries became independent, many saw
    levels of economic development comparable to those of their
    counterparts in Asia.  In 1960, South Korea’s GNP per capita was
    $155, while Ghana’s was $170.   Forty years later, South Korea’s GNP
    per capita was $10,800, while Ghana’s remained $250.  Many
    developing states in Africa tried to promote development by
    following the examples of industrialized states.  They began to
    develop infrastructure, mechanize farming, and expand higher
    education.  This subunit will provide tools for studying economic
    development and will allow you to analyze why some African economies
    struggled while others took off.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this essay by Mary Robinson,  the former
    UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  She discusses the role of
    trade in propelling socio-economic development in Africa.  Pay
    particular attention to the difference between free trade and fair
    trade.  In essence, trade policies of the world’s richest countries
    continue to be a stumbling block to African development, as too many
    markets remain closed to African exports.  Please note that Robinson
    does not limit her argument to trade policies; she also acknowledges
    the pivotal roles of additional factors such as corruption and
    investment.  Also, note the interconnectedness of domestic and
    foreign policies with respect to trade.  Policies that are
    beneficial domestically may have detrimental consequences elsewhere
    and vice versa. Hence, the formulation and implementation of
    mutually successful trade policies is extremely challenging.

     Instructions: Though the goal of foreign aid is to improve economic
    conditions in Africa, it has also led to unintended negative
    effects.  In this article, Bovard points out how foreign aid led to
    dependence and poor economic outcomes.  What do you think?  Do you
    believe foreign aid is bad for Africa?  Are there any weaknesses in
    the article? Compare and contrast Bovard’s arguments to those
    presented by ONE  .

    Instructions: Please read the article linked above. By the 1980s, it
    had become evident that the modernization and industrialization
    policies many African countries had tried to implement had failed.
    Economic underdevelopment and political instability were widespread.
    In 1980, Africa’s external debt reached $15 billion, a large portion
    of which was owed to IMF and the World Bank. In order to accelerate
    economic growth and reduce foreign debt, these institutions
    implemented structural adjustment programs on African countries. In
    this resource, you will read about such programs and evaluate their
    impact in Africa.

    security in Africa?

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: In this speech, Stanley Fischer presents a view on
    globalization from the perspective of the IMF.  Central to this view
    is the notion that globalization is a multifaceted, ancient
    phenomenon   with mixed consequences.  It is paramount to tap into
    the potential benefits of globalization by pursuing economic
    policies that integrate rather than marginalize.  Hence,
    globalization is not necessarily bad for Africa.  
        
     Fischer suggests that Africa can embrace trade and financial
    liberalization and improve its economy.  However, he also points out
    that international actors (such as the IMF and industrialized
    states) must take responsibility in helping Africa in the process. 
    As you read, identify his argument and contrast it with Ifeanyi’s
    article.  Whose arguments are more convincing?  Why?
