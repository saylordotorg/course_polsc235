**Unit 5: Africa and International Relations** <span id="5"></span> 

*African international relations over the past century have been
characterized by a tumultuous interplay of internal and external forces
and events. Such forces and events, ranging from competition over
Africa’s natural resources to African civil wars, have shaped and
continue to shape the nature of international relations within Africa.
During the colonial period, European powers controlled African
international relations. When European power waned during World War II
and African nationalist movements emerged, control over African
international relations began to be restored to Africans. Decolonization
and independence for African states ostensibly completed this process.
However, newly independent African states experienced several challenges
in carving out a space for themselves in the modern state system.
African states entered a system wherein they had no voice. They had to
compete against established states and economic systems. Simultaneously,
African leaders turned to the international community for assistance.
The starting point for engaging the international system in the 1960s
was less than auspicious for independent Africa.*

*In this unit, you will explore several topics central to African
international relations. First, you will consider the historical
dimensions of the Cold War for its devastating manifestations in Africa.
Specifically, newly independent African states began to engage the
international community in an environment marked by suspicion and
competition, fueled by the Cold War between the superpowers (US, USSR,
and their respective allies). Africa became the site of proxy wars
between the superpowers, and increased competition for resources and
influence by external actors made Africa’s engagement with the
international community even more exigent. Second, you will study the
relationship between Africa and the United Nations, as this relationship
is important to any consideration of African international relations.
Third, you will study regional and sub-regional integration efforts in
Africa. Specifically, the creation of the Organization of African Unity
and its successor the African Union highlight the rationale for African
continent-wide cooperation and integration; the experiences related to
these intergovernmental organizations simultaneously illustrate the
difficulties associated with such endeavors. Finally, this unit will
encourage you to consider the nature of armed conflict in Africa and the
ways in which Africa and the international community has responded, and
should respond, to armed conflict.*

    (HTML)

    Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    essay by Dr. Talton. He discusses the ramifications of the timing of
    African independence. For newly independent states, the Cold War
    complicated the processes of nation building, power consolidation,
    and policymaking. The United States and the Soviet Union did not
    hesitate to meddle in African affairs. The Cold War impeded
    decolonization.

     Instructions: Please read the linked material.  Note that the Cold
    War conflict between the United States and Soviet Union played out

    political reasons.  Some of these   states became a battle ground
    for the superpowers; so-called proxy wars were fought in Angola,
    Mozambique, and several other states.

    challenges faced by African states individually and collectively in
    engaging the UN. What mechanisms have African states pursued to
    ‘raise their voices?’

    humanitarianexchange026.pdf.’ The Rwandan genocide of 1994 witnessed
    the slaughter of roughly one million people in the span of 100 days.
    Despite knowledge about what was occurring in this small African
    state, the international community chose not to act. The debate on
    whether to get involved remained a debate rather than a call to
    action. The international community made a conscientious decision
    not to get involved in Rwanda and allowed the massacre to continue.
    . This decision was made despite an obligation under international
    law to intervene on humanitarian grounds. States chose to ignore
    this mandate, ostensibly out of respect for state sovereignty. After
    the Rwandan genocide, the UN Secretary-General challenged the
    international community to reconcile the concepts of state
    sovereignty and humanitarian intervention in order to prevent
    similar situations from occurring in the future. Canada responded to
    the challenge and formed the International Commission on
    Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) in 2000. This body of
    experts released its report ‘The Responsibility to Protect’ in 2001,
    which has become the cornerstone of international responses to
    conflicts.  The article above, written by a member of the ICISS,
    outlines the debate.
