**Unit 7: African Renaissance?** <span id="7"></span> 

*Prior to the end of the Cold War, African leaders used the term
“African Renaissance,” which was later picked up and used by western
analysts. The term refers to a new period of African history marked by
hope and development, growth and prosperity, peace and national
stability, burgeoning efforts at building democracy, and an increase in
the continent’s social and institutional capacity to solve major
problems. The term gained importance on account of Africa’s recent
history, when the emergence of weakened or corrupt states and the threat
of near economic collapse dashed the promise of a better future
following independence. This final unit will begin with the idea that an
African Renaissance is slowly and selectively underway. We will use
smaller case studies that reflect a more hopeful continent as gateways
to reflection about the present and future.  *

    Renaissance, South Africa and the
    World](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/mbeki.html)” (HTML)  

    Instructions: Thabo Mbeki, a former president of South Africa,
    popularized the notion of the African Renaissance. It refers to a
    political and philosophical movement centered on the renewal of
    African agency in the form of direct confrontation of Africa’s ills
    with the goal of devising African solutions to African problems.
    Significant political, economic, social, and cultural developments
    all form part of a reinvigorated engagement geared towards lifting
    the African continent out of poverty and into a more proactive and
    influential position in global politics. Mbeki argued that Africa is
    redefining itself and will reemerge as a new continent in the
    future. Here, you can experience the arguments first-hand through a
    speech Mbeki presented at the United Nations University in 1998.

    style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">As the largest
    economy in Africa, South Africa has the potential to drive African
      economic development.   . Since the end of apartheid and the
    emergence of a multiracial democratic system in 1994, the country
    has also positioned itself to be the political and economic leader
    of the continent. Such leadership roles are reflected in South
    Africa’s engagement with the international community in general and
    its foreign policies in particular.  Yet there appear to be some
    contradictions between South Africa’s history and its present
    policies. The author of this article attempts to explore and explain
    these contradictions.   Additionally, South Africa’s democratic
    transformation and the relatively peaceful coexistence of various
    races make South Africa a model for the rest of the continent.  The
    article mentions several lessons that the country can teach other
    African   states.  Try to identify them while you read.</span>
