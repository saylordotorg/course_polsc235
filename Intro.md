If you pick up almost any newspaper looking for information about
Africa, you will likely encounter stories about the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
Malawi, riots in Tunisia, famine in Ethiopia, or environmental disaster
in the Niger Delta—problems that journalists often link to dysfunctional
government.  Based on such accounts, you might consider Africa to be a
pretty bleak place!  However, these events highlight only one side of
politics in Sub-Saharan Africa.  While some African countries face great
struggles, others offer great hope. This course provides an overview of
African politics in historical context, synthesizing material from
traditional comparative politics and area studies courses that examine
democratization, economic development, and identity politics.  This
course also examines Africa’s position in a broader international
framework by addressing conflict, political economy, and the processes
of state division and integration. Seven units organize this course.  We
have organized the beginning of this course (Units 1 and 2) historically
with Unit 1 focusing on colonization.  Unit 2 reviews political
development patterns in the post-colonial age, including the upheavals
that led to an epidemic of weak and failed states.  Subsequent units
take a more focused look at various dimensions of African society,
politics, economics, and international relations.  The course concludes
with an exploration of continent-wide challenges and the potential for
an “African Renaissance.”

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Explain how colonialism and independence movements contributed to
    and shaped contemporary African statehood.
-   Identify the main causes and manifestations of state weakness in
    Africa.
-   Define underdevelopment and explain its causes in Africa.
-   Discuss the causes of civil conflict in Africa.
-   Apply knowledge of Africa’s history to explain current causes of
    crisis and the roles of different actors within the state and
    international communities.
-   Compare and contrast economically and politically successful states
    with those that are less successful, and identify the causes of this
    variation.
-   Identify and explain some of the major social, cultural, and
    economic challenges (such as HIV/AIDS) that contemporary African
    states face, as well as the role international actors play in
    addressing these challenges.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC325.  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer**: Mike Kuchinsky, Daniel Fikreyesus, and Ulrike
Gutberlet  
    
 **Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Michigan State University’s “[Exploring
    Africa](http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/)”
-   The BBC World Service’s “[The Story of
    Africa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/index.shtml)”
-   Sweden’s “[Nordic Africa Institute](http://www.nai.uu.se/)”
-   The New York Public Library’s “[Schomburg Center for Research in
    Black Culture](http://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg)”

Additionally, materials offered by various IGOs (i.e. African Union,
United Nations, Southern African Development Community) and NGOs (i.e.
Amnesty International, ONE, Green Belt Movement) are integrated
throughout the course.  These materials are supplemented by a range of
scholarly articles, audio and video clips, and other readings.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Politics and political science are intrinsically complex and integrate a
myriad of social, economic, and cultural dynamics. Therefore, this
course will require you to revisit previous units to undertake a
comprehensive analysis of the subject matter.  This progression yields a
more thorough understanding of political and socio-economic trends,
patterns, and discontinuities in Sub-Saharan Africa.  You will also need
to complete:  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the materials in each unit.  
  
 In order to successfully complete this course, you will need to earn a
70% or higher on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be
tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you
may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you approximately
**105 **hours to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
These time advisories are approximate estimates; please feel free to
work at your own pace. Also, the time advisories do not factor in the
time you spend thinking about and reflecting on the material.  
    
 Nonetheless, the time advisories should help you plan your time
accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories,
determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit, and then set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should
take you 17 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 5 hours) on Monday night;
subunit 1.2 (a total of 2.75 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.
