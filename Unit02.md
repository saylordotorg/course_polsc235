**Unit 2: The Trajectory of African Politics in the Post-Colonial Era**
<span id="2"></span> 
*The post-colonial independence period was a time of euphoria and
hope—at least for those who would take on the reins of power.  It became
apparent that the consolidation of statehood in the post-colonial period
took longer and was more violent for some countries than it was for
others.  As African states earned their independence, they often adopted
characteristics of modern Western Europe, developing mixed capitalist
economies, interventionist government, and multi-party politics.  Many
of these characteristics changed in the first two decades of
independence. The competition between Cold War super powers played out
on the continent; multi-party politics yielded to single-party rule and
clientelism; in some cases, an activist state became oppressive;
military coups  subverted civilian rule; nationalism competed with
ethnic and religious sub-national interests for legitimacy; and
economies that were once on par with many states in Asiasuccumbed
todisrepair, dependency, and debt.*

    article to access the text.  By the mid 1960s, more than 40 African
    states had freed themselves from colonial rule and drafted
    democratic constitutions.  Many of these new states emerged after
    multiparty elections brought new African-led governments to power. 
    However, most of the regimes collapsed and reverted to military or
    authoritarian rule.  Others degenerated into one-party rule,
    marginalizing or banning opposition parties.   In this unit, you
    will study the political process that led to the reversal of
    democracy and the emergence of various forms of authoritarianism.

    statistics.  Instead, focus on the written analysis, and read for
    the main arguments.  Note that clientelism is a political and
    economic system characterized by "patron-client" relationships. 
    African politics is commonly characterized as clientelistic, as it
    emerged out of the “neo-patrimonialism” system in which politicians
    were given jobs in exchange for service to the ruler.  This system
    of “personal rule” has led to corruption and the concentration of
    power in the hands of one or a few rulers, allowing the state to
    operate as a private enterprise while it pretends to be public.

    high incidence of state failure in Africa?
